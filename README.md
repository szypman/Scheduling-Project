# Scheduling-Project
For APCSA Final Project

  This is my final project for APCSA, and it is a scheduling program that can be used by guidance counselors to formulate schedules for students. A prerequisite for this program is that students must have chosen desired classes beforehand. The number of preferences can vary based on the school, but for this project I had "students" "choose" 7 classes from a total of 10 classes offered. In this project, each student's schedule consists of 5 classes, but once again this number can be easily manipulated based on each school's necessities. It works on a first-come first-serve basis, and if all a student's desired classes are filled up by other students, they will be given a class that is outside their list of preferences. This way, every student's schedule is complete. While students are not guaranteed to receive all of their preferences, the fact that they choose 7 classes and each schedule has 5 classes increases their chance of getting many, if not all, of their choices. 
  Creating this program has helped me apply concepts I learned throughout the year such as arrays and ArrayLists, classes and objects, conditionals, etc. to a larger scale project, and it helped revisit topics and thus refine my skills.
